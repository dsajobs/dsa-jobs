5,Digital Twin_NPAMT,68465,GlaxoSmithKline / Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing Pte Ltd,1,"Jul 5, 21","Dec 31, 21","Opportunity Statement

Dolutegravir (or “DTG”) was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2013. It a critically important antiretroviral medicine that is set to become the backbone of many countries HIV programmes. It is therefore very important to minimise the cost of DTG and make it more accessible to a wider group of patients.

The recent Dolutegravir Stage-1 Campaign 4 at Jurong ran from 14 -Feb-19 to 06 -Mar -19 and 13 batches were manufactured successfully. The typical constraints of the DTG process is safety, quality performance, and adherence to ATSP. Despite a small campaign size of 13 batches (compare to 38 batches campaign previously), the Campaign Result was a great success and the Yield performance record of 73.21%, was observed.

The long-term Objective of the site is to “Improve the yield efficiency campaign over campaign, to improve the cost of goods for Dolutegravir, and to make Jurong site the heart of HIV supply chain”.

As a drive in this direction and to assist the site achieve this goal, a low-cost, safe and validated Digital Twin approach would be pursued. A Digital Twin in brief is a simulated representation of physical plant assets and underlying chemical/physical processes within them (i.e. chemical reactions, separation processes, heat transfer, process equipment, instrumentation and controls). It understands, troubleshoots, predicts and optimizes performance to achieve improved business outcomes.

Project scope

For this project, one of the key DTG process unit will be chosen as a test-bed to build digital twin, and the aim would be the model to closely resemble the real unit on site. The model would be reconciled with the plant data to closely mimic the actual operating unit op on site, literally acting as a live (or offline) Twin. The twin model will be validated with plant data (static and dynamic data), optimized and examined for process control studies to minimize variability in the outputs (CQAs).

Learning outcome

The Twin if successful can also support as a key validation tool to facilitate safe, low-cost testing of change orders and help run unit/plant close to optimal solutions. The twin model if desired can be tasked to connect with live plant data and used for monitoring and quality adherence tasks. The long-term objective would be to use the twin model that can be used for OPEX, CAPEX and Maintenance initiatives.
The student will learn about Pharma Primary Manufacturing. The student will acquire knowledge on the interconnectivity across operational, engineering and quality functions to deliver the new technology solution for improving the reliability of equipment for plant operation. The student will be immersed in the site activities and understand how compliance to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is critical to the site.

15,Chief Data Officer Office Data Management Projects Jul-Dec22,143352,Health Promotion Board,1,"Jul 4, 22","Dec 30, 22","Looking for an internship that actually makes a difference?

Join us at the Forefront of Shaping Healthier Lives

Overview

The Health Promotion Board’s vision is to make Singapore a nation of healthier people.

Come be a part of this journey if you’re passionate about creating boundary-pushing work that drives behavioral change.

Overview of the Health Promotion Board / Chief Data Officer Office (CDOO)

The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is working towards a 5-year Precision Public Health (PPH) strategy to deliver more personalised and engaging lifestyle programmes to sustain holistic health habits at a population level. This will in turn translate to better health outcomes and reduced disease burden for Singapore through increased scalability and reach of impactful programmes, informed by deep understanding of individual’s health and wellness needs.

To date, a vast amount of data has been collected by various HPB population-level programs that are domain-centric (e.g., physical activity, health screening, healthy dining), demographic-centric (e.g., school-going children, workplace, seniors). In the last few years, HPB commenced several strategic partnership projects for cross-domain, demographic-agonistic data collection and intervention (e.g., HiSG, LumiHealth). Learnings from these strategic projects could be transplanted to future HPB mainstream programs to offer citizens access to an integrated and holistic health journey personalised to their individual motivations and progression, delivered at the right time through the right touch points.

To achieve this, HPB needs to leverage the rich retrospective and prospective individual level data amalgamated across diverse HPB programmes and research platforms to deliver personalised interventions and messages to drive different behavioural changes. However, concerted efforts are needed to design and implement a person-centric data architecture than spans diverse domains and demographics, as well as to clean, pre-process, validate and link existing data so that standardized and high-quality features can be created to serve as the board-wide single-source of truth for further exploitation internally or in collaboration with HPB partners (e.g., academics, AI.SG, SDSC, A*STAR etc). While the usage of combined data sets maximizes the value of data, it also increases the vulnerability (e.g., increased risk of privacy invasion), thus necessitating proper data management, governance, and protection policies at the board level.

In view of the above, the Chief Data Officer Office (CDOO) is set up to advance the data-driven, evidence-based and citizen-centric approach to health promotion through state-of-the-art data best practices to maximize data quality, and internationally recognized governance and policies to promote safe usage of data. It does so through the Data Operations and Architecture Department and the Data Governance & Compliance Department.

Overview of Data Governance & Compliance Department

The Data Governance & Compliance Department will define and implement the data strategy for HPB and ensure that data is accessed, modified, used, and distributed securely.  As the custodian of all HPB data, the department will play a pivotal role in the provision of a secured environment to ensure that data is stored, processed, and distributed safely. The department will also work closely with other governmental agencies and strategic partners to bring in their data securely onto the platform to benefit citizens.

Overview of Data Operations & Architecture Department

Recognising the efficacy of big data and artificial intelligence in optimising sharper insights and outcomes for public health, the Data Operations and Architecture Department will take a proactive role to drive the design of a 360-view citizen-centric data architecture and the implementation of data operations to support and facilitate an evidence-based, data-driven approach to programme delivery. The department will set up and implement data architecture and structuring, cleaning and validation of big data from diverse HPB and partners’ data sources (e.g. food transaction data, sports attendance data, screening and sensor data) to facilitate data feature engineering use cases pivotal to downstream data exploitation. The department will also be involved in strategic collaborations with partners (e.g. public healthcare and data science institutions, academics and technology players) to bring in their data and expertise onto the data operations to benefit citizens.

What You Can Expect

As an intern with Chief Data Officer Office, you will be involved in one of the following projects.

Title of project 1: Enabling a Safe Data Environment for HPB

Title of project 2: Building Data Pipeline to Enable Data Driven Work within HPB

Department: Data Operations & Architecture

As HPB embarks on its journey towards data-driven Precision Public Health (PPH), it is essential to have a robust data engineering pipeline that can integrate the vast wealth of data HPB has through its numerous data sources. A robust data pipeline ensures that changes from the data sources are able to be quickly resolved and does not bring about impact to all existing data pipeline, in order for a timely delivery of data to the end user.

You can expect to:

·        Design optimal data structures for strategic datasets and drive data engineering processes related to data ingestion, data imputation, data transformation and integration to facilitate data science and analytics use cases

·        Build optimised, test driven codes to achieve the above mentioned

·        Translate research and analytics questions into data features to facilitate dashboarding, model training, analytics, and data science applications

·        Build test case on code to ensure that all codes are built to perfection

Title of project 3: Building Data Architecture for Citizen-Centric View for Health Promotion

Department:  Data Operations & Architecture

Overview

The Health Promotion Board’s vision is to make Singapore a nation of healthier people.

Come be a part of this journey if you’re passionate about creating boundary-pushing work that drives behavioral change.

Overview of the Health Promotion Board / Chief Data Officer Office (CDOO)

The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is working towards a 5-year Precision Public Health (PPH) strategy to deliver more personalised and engaging lifestyle programmes to sustain holistic health habits at a population level. This will in turn translate to better health outcomes and reduced disease burden for Singapore through increased scalability and reach of impactful programmes, informed by deep understanding of individual’s health and wellness needs.

To date, a vast amount of data has been collected by various HPB population-level programs that are domain-centric (e.g., physical activity, health screening, healthy dining), demographic-centric (e.g., school-going children, workplace, seniors). In the last few years, HPB commenced several strategic partnership projects for cross-domain, demographic-agonistic data collection and intervention (e.g., HiSG, LumiHealth). Learnings from these strategic projects could be transplanted to future HPB mainstream programs to offer citizens access to an integrated and holistic health journey personalised to their individual motivations and progression, delivered at the right time through the right touch points.

To achieve this, HPB needs to leverage the rich retrospective and prospective individual level data amalgamated across diverse HPB programmes and research platforms to deliver personalised interventions and messages to drive different behavioural changes. However, concerted efforts are needed to design and implement a person-centric data architecture than spans diverse domains and demographics, as well as to clean, pre-process, validate and link existing data so that standardized and high-quality features can be created to serve as the board-wide single-source of truth for further exploitation internally or in collaboration with HPB partners (e.g., academics, AI.SG, SDSC, A*STAR etc). While the usage of combined data sets maximizes the value of data, it also increases the vulnerability (e.g., increased risk of privacy invasion), thus necessitating proper data management, governance, and protection policies at the board level.

In view of the above, the Chief Data Officer Office (CDOO) is set up to advance the data-driven, evidence-based and citizen-centric approach to health promotion through state-of-the-art data best practices to maximize data quality, and internationally recognized governance and policies to promote safe usage of data. It does so through the Data Operations and Architecture Department and the Data Governance & Compliance Department.

Overview of Data Governance & Compliance Department

The Data Governance & Compliance Department will define and implement the data strategy for HPB and ensure that data is accessed, modified, used, and distributed securely.  As the custodian of all HPB data, the department will play a pivotal role in the provision of a secured environment to ensure that data is stored, processed, and distributed safely. The department will also work closely with other governmental agencies and strategic partners to bring in their data securely onto the platform to benefit citizens.

Overview of Data Operations & Architecture Department

Recognising the efficacy of big data and artificial intelligence in optimising sharper insights and outcomes for public health, the Data Operations and Architecture Department will take a proactive role to drive the design of a 360-view citizen-centric data architecture and the implementation of data operations to support and facilitate an evidence-based, data-driven approach to programme delivery. The department will set up and implement data architecture and structuring, cleaning and validation of big data from diverse HPB and partners’ data sources (e.g. food transaction data, sports attendance data, screening and sensor data) to facilitate data feature engineering use cases pivotal to downstream data exploitation. The department will also be involved in strategic collaborations with partners (e.g. public healthcare and data science institutions, academics and technology players) to bring in their data and expertise onto the data operations to benefit citizens.

The Health Promotion Board’s vision is to make Singapore a nation of healthier people.

Come be a part of this journey if you’re passionate about creating boundary-pushing work that drives behavioral change.

Overview of the Health Promotion Board / Chief Data Officer Office (CDOO)

The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is working towards a 5-year Precision Public Health (PPH) strategy to deliver more personalised and engaging lifestyle programmes to sustain holistic health habits at a population level. This will in turn translate to better health outcomes and reduced disease burden for Singapore through increased scalability and reach of impactful programmes, informed by deep understanding of individual’s health and wellness needs.

To date, a vast amount of data has been collected by various HPB population-level programs that are domain-centric (e.g., physical activity, health screening, healthy dining), demographic-centric (e.g., school-going children, workplace, seniors). In the last few years, HPB commenced several strategic partnership projects for cross-domain, demographic-agonistic data collection and intervention (e.g., HiSG, LumiHealth). Learnings from these strategic projects could be transplanted to future HPB mainstream programs to offer citizens access to an integrated and holistic health journey personalised to their individual motivations and progression, delivered at the right time through the right touch points.

To achieve this, HPB needs to leverage the rich retrospective and prospective individual level data amalgamated across diverse HPB programmes and research platforms to deliver personalised interventions and messages to drive different behavioural changes. However, concerted efforts are needed to design and implement a person-centric data architecture than spans diverse domains and demographics, as well as to clean, pre-process, validate and link existing data so that standardized and high-quality features can be created to serve as the board-wide single-source of truth for further exploitation internally or in collaboration with HPB partners (e.g., academics, AI.SG, SDSC, A*STAR etc).
