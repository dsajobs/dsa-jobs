### **Introduction**
According to many, Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st Century. In our fast-moving digitalised world, more and more data are being generated and processed. In fact, a whooping estimate of 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data are being generated every single day! And thatâ€™s why Data Scientists are very sought after by many industries today.

With the rise in demand of Data Science, we feel that there is a need for a customised data science job portal, so that future data scientists can find a job that suits one's interests, needs and wants much more efficiently. 

Our portal is mainly catered to Data Science undergraduates who are actively seeking an internship or a job. Regardless if you are looking for your first internship, or a fresh graduate looking for a job, our portal aims to personalise your job search such that you may find a more suited job based on your interests through your resume.

## Key Application Features

On top of the usual filters of a job portal, we have additionally implemented 3 key features in our application that make us unique.

### 1) Calendar View: 

As different jobs have different job application deadlines, we have decided to create a calendar view for the end-user to view all the deadlines of the various job openings at a glance.

### 2) Radar Graph: 

The radar graph is a personalised spider-like chart which will match the similarity of the job description to your interests/skillsets based on your preferences and your resume. It will also indicate a percentage of how likely you will fit in the job. This will allow the end-user to hopefully make a better informed decision on which jobs to apply for based on their interests.

### 3) Quick Links: 

We have also decided to include relevant links that can be easily accessed from each job description. The end-user may have easy direct access to the company's webpage if they wish to find out more, and also quick link to directly apply for the job.
