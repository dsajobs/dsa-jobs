### Fully Coded Components

Notus React is built with over frontend 120 components, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colors, that you can easily modify using Tailwind CSS classes (NOTE: each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`, you will need to compile again tailwind).

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Tailwind CSS Template is coming with prebuilt examples, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

Every element has multiple states for colors, styles, hover, focus, that you can easily access and use.

# Introduction
According to many, Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st Century. In our fast-moving digitalised world, more and more data are being generated and processed. In fact, a whooping estimate of 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data are being generated every single day! And thatâ€™s why Data Scientists are very sought after by many industries today.

With the rise in demand of Data Science, we feel that there is a need for a customised data science job portal, so that future data scientists can find a job that suits one's interests, needs and wants much more efficiently. 

Our portal is mainly catered to Data Science undergraduates who are actively seeking an internship or a job. Regardless if you are looking for your first internship, or a fresh graduate looking for a job, our portal aims to personalise your job search such that you may find a more suited job based on your interests through you resume.
