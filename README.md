### **Introduction**
According to many, Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st Century. In our fast-moving digitalised world, more and more data are being generated and processed. In fact, a whooping estimate of 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data are being generated every single day! And thatâ€™s why Data Scientists are very sought after by many industries today.

With the rise in demand of Data Science, we feel that there is a need for a customised data science job portal, so that future data scientists can find a job that suits one's interests, needs and wants much more efficiently. 

Our portal is mainly catered to Data Science undergraduates who are actively seeking an internship or a job. Regardless if you are looking for your first internship, or a fresh graduate looking for a job, our portal aims to personalise your job search such that you may find a more suited job based on your interests through your resume.

### **Welcome to our One-Stop Data Science Job Portal!**

We have 4 main pages:
1) Main Landing Page
2) Login/Register Page
3) Job Listing Page
4) Profile Page

### **Main Landing Page**

This is where the end-user will first visit when he/she accesses our job portal. 
To get the end-user started, We have included a resume upload function for the end-user to begin on his/her job search journey. 
At the bottom of the landing page, it has various links to relevant resources that the end-user might find useful as well.



### **Login/Register Page**

Here is where the end-user may sign in using their school account or Google account to have better access to our portal.



### **Job Listing Page**

This is where the end-user may view the various job postings from employers.

We have implemented 3 distinct features for each job description:

1) Calendar View: 

    As different jobs have different job application deadlines, we have decided to create a calendar view for the end-user to view all the deadlines of the various job openings at a glance.


2) Radar Graph: 

    The radar graph is a personalised spider-like chart which will match the similarity of the job description to your interests/skillsets based on your preferences and your resume. It will also indicate a percentage of how likely you will fit in the job. This will allow the end-user to hopefully make a better informed decision on which jobs to apply for based on their interests.


3) Quick Links: 

    We have also decided to include links of the various employers in the job description so that end-users may find out more about the company by accessing their website easily.



### **Profile Page**
The end-user may edit or update his/her profile details and profile picture here. He/she may indicate their preferences and interests in this page too.
